## Addition 4

- This feature is a new game called Three Cup Monte! The game will have a ball in a random cup out of 3 cups, and the objective is to guess which cup the ball is in after the cups are shuffled. Picking a cup is simple, all you have to do is enter the number of the cup you want to choose and voila, you either win or lose.
